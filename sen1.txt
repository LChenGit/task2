Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the Synthesis of Short Chain Fatty Acid.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce short chain carboxylic acids (C6 to C10) from glucose using the heterologous Homo sapiens type I fatty acid synthase (hFAS).
Using the native yeast fatty acid synthase for growth, the overexpression of the hFAS mutants and the growth, the overexpression of the hFAS mutants and the short-chain TEs (linked or plasmid-based) increased in vivo short-chain TEs (linked or plasmid-based) increased in vivo caprylic acid and total SCFA production up to 64-fold caprylic acid and total SCFA production up to 64-fold (63 mg/L) and 52-fold (68 mg/L), respectively, over the native (63 mg/L) and 52-fold (68 mg/L), respectively, over the native yeast levels. 
Combined over-expression of the phosphopantetheine transferase with the hFAS mutant resulted in C8 titers of up to 82 mg/L and total SCFA titers of up to 111 mg/L.
Yeast and Bacterial Strains.
Media and Cultivation.
complex YPD media (10 or 20 g/L dextrose, 20 g/L peptone, 10 g/L yeast extract (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD)), semi-defined SDC-A media (20 g/L dextrose, 5 g/L casamino acids, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and supplementary constituents as needed: 100 mg/L adenine sulfate, 100 mg/L uracil, 100 mg/L L-histidine-HCL, 100 mg/L L-methionine, 150 mg/L L-leucine, 150 mg/L L-lysine-HCL) (Amberg et al., 2005). 
All plates contained 20 g/L Bacto-agar. 
For expression studies using the ADH2 promoter, YPD with 10 g/L dextrose was used. 
For expression studies using the PGK1 promoter, selective SDC-A medium was used. 
In these media, glucose is exhausted before 20 h. For the FAS2 knockout strain, the medium contained 2mM myristic acid with tween 40 (5 g/L) to supplement growth (Chirala et al., 1987). 
The fatty acid supplement was heated to 55C for 30 min to increase solubility and then filter-sterilized.
Four strains, BJASFP and BJAACPS expressing either the linked hFAS-TEII (pXP842-hFAS-TEII) or the linked hFAS- CpFatB1 (pXP842-hFAS-CpFatB1), were compared to the control strain BJ5464 (Fig. 8). 
Extracellular fatty acid levels increased for all measurable SCFAs relative to the BJ5464 control (Fig. 8). 
Linking the TE improved caprylic acid production 4- to 9-fold over the unlinked counterparts (Fig. 7), indicating the importance ofthe TE proximity to the FAS. 
Strain BJASFP expressing linked hFAS-TEII produced the highest SCFA titers, reaching 63 mg/L C8 and 68 mg/L total SCFA. 
Increasing SFP synthesis using a 2m vector increased C8 and SCFA levels by roughly an additional 30% to 82 mg/L and 111 mg/L, respectively.
Yeast strains expressing the native yeast FAS (for C16 and C18 production), an hFAS mutant deficient in the TE domain and short chain TEs were constructed. 
This resulted in a 17-fold increase in C8 levels compared to the wild-type strain in vivo. 
Linking the short chain TEs to the hFAS resulted in a 4- to 9-fold increase in C8 levels over the unlinked counterparts and a 64-fold increase over the wild- type strain. 
Combined over-expression of the PPT with the hFAS mutant resulted in C8 titers up to 82 mg/L and total SCFA titers up to 111 mg/L.
